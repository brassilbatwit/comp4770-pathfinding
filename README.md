Search Algorithms in Games: Interactive Simulator Guide

Introduction: 
Imagine you're playing a game. Your character needs to find a way through a maze, escape a dungeon, or chase down an enemy across a tiled battlefield. Behind every movement lies a question: "What’s the best way to get from here to there?"
That question is at the heart of search — a fundamental idea that powers everything from NPC movement to player navigation, patrol routes, chase mechanics, and beyond.
In many games, the environment is made of nodes (like tiles or waypoints), and characters must find paths through this network — avoiding danger, reducing cost, and reacting to changing conditions. Whether you’re playing a tower defense game, designing AI for a stealth enemy, or coding a tactical grid-based level, pathfinding matters.
 
The search grid before solving – each tile could be an opportunity or a dead end.
Good search algorithms are like smart travelers. They not only look at the map but also make smart decisions based on their goals and the terrain. Should the NPC go through the swamp (and pay a heavy cost) or take the longer, safer route? Should a ghost in a maze chase the player head-on or cut them off?
This is what we explore in this project:
•	Different ways to search (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, A*)
•	How terrain types like walls and swamps affect decisions
•	How smart guesses (heuristics) improve performance
•	What happens when choices go wrong
In the following sections, we’ll use our Unity-based search simulator to visualize how each algorithm behaves, what decisions it makes, and how it finds (or fails to find) a path from start to goal. You'll be able to tweak the world, change the algorithm, and observe how behavior changes — all in real-time.
Search isn't just a computer science term. It's a lens for understanding how virtual characters think. And once you see it, you'll notice it in every game you play.

Our World: The Search Grid Simulator
We’ve built a simple, interactive grid world inside Unity. Think of it as a sandbox where you can test how different search algorithms behave in a controlled environment. You can place obstacles, assign terrain types, and switch between strategies like A*, BFS, and Dijkstra — all with just a few clicks.
Each tile on the grid represents a cell in the game world. These tiles can take on different roles:
Tile Type	Meaning	Visual
🟩 Start	Beginning of the path	Green
🟦 Goal	Destination tile	Blue
⬜ Open	Free tile, normal movement	White
⬛ Wall	Impassable terrain	Black
🟨 Swamp	Costly terrain (3x movement)	Yellow
🎯 Your objective as the player:
Design a terrain layout, place a start and goal tile, and choose a search algorithm to find the path.
 
Start simple: open terrain, clean path, ready to search.

🧩 Controls & Interactions
Action	Input
Place a wall	Left-click
Place a swamp tile	Shift + Click
Clear tile to open	Right-click
Set Start	Press S + Click
Set Goal	Press G + Click
Run Search	Click Find Path button
Reset world	Click Reset button
Change algorithm	Use the dropdown menu
As you paint the map and assign tile types, you’re essentially building a search graph. Each tile becomes a node, and valid movements form the edges. Once you hit Find Path, the selected algorithm gets to work.
 

A* finds the optimal route while avoiding costly terrain.
Real-Time Feedback
This simulator gives you more than just a path:
•	Arrows are drawn to show the exact route.
•	Tiles that were explored during the search are shaded:
o	Cyan for open set (in consideration)
o	Gray for closed set (already visited)
•	A console and on-screen text display the path taken and the total cost.
•	You can change tile types and rerun the search instantly — no need to restart.
    
“Different algorithms, same map — very different behavior.
3. Exploring the Algorithms
Now that you understand the grid world, let’s see how different search strategies behave within it.
Each algorithm follows its own logic for finding the best path — or sometimes, just a path — between the start and goal tiles. In this section, we walk through how each strategy operates, using visuals from the simulator to highlight their strengths, weaknesses, and unique characteristics.
Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS dives as deep as it can into one path before backtracking. It explores paths one at a time, which can lead it far from the goal before realizing it’s on the wrong track.
Characteristics:
•	Favors depth over breadth
•	Fast in small spaces
•	Can get stuck exploring dead ends
•	Not guaranteed to find the shortest path
🔎 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS explores outward in waves, checking all neighboring nodes before moving deeper. It guarantees the shortest path if all tiles cost the same.
Characteristics:
•	Guarantees shortest path in uniform cost
•	Can be slow and memory-heavy
•	Ignores terrain cost
🔎 Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Dijkstra takes terrain cost into account. It’s similar to BFS but uses a priority queue that favors cheaper paths. It explores all options methodically.
Characteristics:
•	Finds the cheapest path based on cost
•	Slower than A* since it lacks direction
•	Great for terrain-heavy or variable-cost maps
A* Search
A* is the best of both worlds: it uses Dijkstra’s logic plus a heuristic (a “guess”) to prioritize nodes that look promising.
Characteristics:
•	Fast and optimal (with an admissible heuristic)
•	Balances exploration and direction
•	Highly customizable with heuristics
4. Heuristics and Terrain: Changing the Rules
The heart of A*’s speed is its heuristic — a guess at how far the goal is from any tile. By tweaking this guess, we change how the algorithm searches.
We implemented three heuristic options in our simulator:
Heuristic	Formula	Best For
Manhattan	`	x1 - x2
Euclidean	√((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²)	Smooth or radial motion
Diagonal	`max(	dx
Terrain Types and Cost
Tiles are not created equal. Some cost more to traverse. In our simulator:
•	Open tiles: cost = 1
•	Swamp tiles: cost = 3
•	Walls: impassable
A* and Dijkstra will intelligently avoid swamps if the cost outweighs the shortcut. BFS and DFS, however, won’t care — they treat all tiles equally.
5. Design Choices and Visual Feedback
Our simulator is not just functional — it’s built to be visually expressive and intuitive. Every part of the interface was designed to give immediate feedback to the player (or student) about how the algorithm is thinking.
Arrows Show the Path
Once a search completes, the chosen path is revealed using a line of directional arrows. Each arrow points from one tile to the next, clearly illustrating the route the algorithm picked.
•	This helps players visualize decisions step-by-step.
•	Arrows appear above tiles and adapt to the direction of movement.
•	The entire path becomes easy to follow — even through swamps and around walls.
Tile Colors as Meaning
Each tile tells a story through its color:
Tile Color	Meaning
🟩 Green	Start tile
🟦 Blue	Goal tile
🟨 Yellow	Swamp tile (slow)
⬛ Black	Wall (blocked)
⬜ White	Default open tile
🌫 Gray	Visited (closed set)
🟦 Cyan	Frontier (open set)
Color changes happen in real time, letting students see the algorithm’s progress as it explores.
🔄 Paint, Clear, Rerun
The real magic is in experimentation. Players can:
•	Use their mouse to paint walls, swamps, or open tiles
•	Change the start and goal at any time
•	Reset the grid with one button
•	Instantly rerun the search to see new results
This makes the simulator ideal for:
•	Testing “what if” scenarios
•	Debugging search behavior
•	Learning through trial and error
Each Algorithm Has Its Own Personality
Algorithm	Key Behavior
DFS	Goes deep, often inefficient
BFS	Finds shortest path (if cost is equal)
Dijkstra	Considers terrain, explores thoroughly
A*	Balances direction + cost, very efficient
These aren’t just technical distinctions — they change the behavior of characters in your game.
•	A* feels smart and deliberate.
•	DFS can act reckless or aggressive.
•	Dijkstra mimics careful and cautious movement.
By mixing terrain types:
•	Walls create hard constraints — blocking routes completely.
•	Swamps create soft obstacles — routes are still possible, just expensive.
These conditions teach players how algorithms adapt:
•	BFS blindly charges into swamps if it’s shortest in steps.
•	A* might loop around swamps to reduce cost.
•	Dijkstra evaluates everything — no guesswork, just math.
Design Insight for Game Developers
Understanding these algorithms informs how you design AI in real games:
•	Should enemies take the most efficient path — or a believable one?
•	What happens if terrain changes mid-game?
•	How can players exploit or manipulate search behavior?

7. Future Improvements
The beauty of our Unity-based search simulator is that it’s a foundation — not a finished product. It’s intentionally simple and transparent, making it a perfect launchpad for future experimentation, learning, and game-ready enhancements.
Here are some ideas to build on what you've created so far:
Weighted A*
What if you want to prioritize speed over precision? Or give more weight to heuristic guidance than terrain cost?
Weighted A* modifies the A* formula to be more aggressive or cautious based on a weight multiplier applied to the heuristic:
f(n) = g(n) + w * h(n)
Where w > 1 makes the search faster but possibly suboptimal. Tuning this weight helps create more dynamic or risk-tolerant AI behaviors.
Bi-Directional Search
Instead of searching from start to goal, why not search from both ends simultaneously?
Bi-directional search uses two frontiers that meet in the middle — potentially halving the search space.
Benefits:
•	Faster on large maps
•	Great for symmetrical environments
•	Encourages better node tracking and merging logic
Dynamic Obstacles
What happens when the world changes after the search starts?
Add:
•	Moving enemies (turn into walls dynamically)
•	Doors that open/close
•	Tiles that become swamps over time
This tests your algorithm’s ability to adapt and replan routes in real-time.
⏱️ Real-Time Replanning (A*-Lite)
Inspired by robotics and real-world AI, real-time A* systems:
•	Execute partial paths
•	Recalculate on the fly as the agent moves
•	Useful for games with fog of war or surprise hazards
This leads into local planning, decision trees, or hybrid FSMs + pathfinding.
Integration with NavMesh or ML Agents
Unity already supports NavMesh navigation, but your simulator is lower-level and customizable.
Advanced students or developers can:
•	Replace the grid with Unity's NavMesh
•	Feed the pathfinding results into a Unity ML-Agent for learning adaptive strategies
•	Use reinforcement learning to improve search heuristics over time


Challenge: Make It Your Own
•	Can you implement Jump Point Search?
•	What if you add turn costs or combat zones?
•	Could enemies cooperate using shared path knowledge?
Every change introduces new design questions, balancing realism, efficiency, and gameplay feel.
The real value of this project is in what it unlocks. Once you understand how search works, you start to see opportunities to design smarter AI, more believable agents, and more engaging player experiences.
So tweak the code. Paint new maps. Stress-test the system. Then break it — and build it better.
